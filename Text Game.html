<title>Basement Dweller</title>
<!-- The player finds themselves in a basement, chained, and unsure of their location, but their dog is stuck in a cage, and they have to free them and get out. 
There are two choices of exiting, the basement door, which has an alarm on it that can be disabled, or the front door, which is locked from the inside.
If the player makes mistakes, they will call to attention the antagonist that will prevent them from escaping. -->
